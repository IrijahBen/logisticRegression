# logisticRegression



Logistic Regression is a popular and widely used statistical method for binary classification problems. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a binary outcome (i.e., two possible classes, typically represented as 0 and 1) based on one or more predictor variables (features).

The term "logistic" in Logistic Regression comes from the use of the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to model the relationship between the input features and the binary output. The sigmoid function is defined as follows:

f(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

In Logistic Regression, the input features are combined linearly with their corresponding coefficients, and the result is passed through the sigmoid function. This transforms the output into a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of belonging to one of the binary classes. If the probability is greater than or equal to 0.5, the instance is predicted to belong to class 1; otherwise, it is predicted to belong to class 0.
